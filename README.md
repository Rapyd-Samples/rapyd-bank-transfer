# Rapyd Bank Transfer Integration

## Overview

The e-commerce industry is growing rapidly, with more businesses moving towards selling products or services online. Offering bank transfers as a payment method is crucial to helping customers purchase items from your portal. However, implementing bank transfers across different banks and regions can be a complex task. Rapyd makes it easy with its **Bank Transfer API**, enabling you to accept and manage payments with ease.

This repository demonstrates how to implement a bank transfer payment method using the **Rapyd Payment API**. With Rapyd, you can handle local and international payments, helping your business reach new markets and expand globally. The API is available for various programming languages, and in this example, the backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, while the frontend is created with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Features

- **Seamless Bank Transfers**: Accept payments directly from customer bank accounts.
- **International Payments**: Simplify international payments by integrating different banks for different countries.

2. **Accepting International Payments**: Implement international bank transfers and grow your business without worrying about cross-border complexities.
3. **Sending Funds Internationally**: Enable easy international fund transfers through a single platform.

## Workflow

1. Customer selects the bank transfer option at checkout.
